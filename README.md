### Project Title
bikeshare
### Description
A bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.
